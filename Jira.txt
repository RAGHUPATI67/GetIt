		Test Cycle 1:
		-------------
		1000 TC > Execute 1000 TC  > 200 Defects
		200 Defects are reported
			
			Developer will Fix Defects & Updated Product/software will be given to 		you/tester once again.

		In Test Cycle 3 in above you met required Quality.
7.Test Clouser Activity
	>Storing & Sharing Artifacts/Documents
	>Storing & Sharing Experience


Managing Test Cycle also possible in Case of JIRA.



Agile:
-----
Product Backlog : Total Pending Requirement/User Story for Complete Product
Sprint Backlog  : Total Pending requirment / User Story for One Iteration

1000 User Story
250 req  > R1  >
250 req	 > R2
250 req  > R3
250 req  > R4

1st Day of Engineering
 Total Subject to Clear Degree : 40    : Product Backlog ()
 Total Subject  per Sem to Clear : 5

Scrum Master : Team Lead > Gives Guidance & Support
Product Owner : BA


Whole Team Approach:
--------------------
A group is framed in Which designer, programmer, tester, customer representative will be involve.


Adv:
1.Quality is not responsibility of indivisual person its a group responsibility.
2.Customer is acting as immediate Validator which will give high Quality of End Product
3.There will be 15 min Daily StandUp Meeting (Due to this transParancy within team is there)
	- What Happened YesterDay
	- Any bottleneck ?
	- What is Planned for Today ?
4.Scrum Board also Adds in transParancy: (Notice Board of Your Collage)
